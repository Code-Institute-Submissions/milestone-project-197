                    Hackathon Winner 2020</h5>
                <p>
                    In November of 2020, our team for our annual company hackathon was voted the Winner! Our goal was to build an internal hub, where important information from a varient of products would be housed. This would offer oversight to the end user of all of their actionables, holidays, meetings, calls and a feed from our live chat product of important announcements.<br>
                    My role in this project was to attain the key information needed through various product API's. With use of Google's Go(Lang) I was able to fetch and write the information we needed to a database and later assisted the team with the key information layout.
                    This is still currently an internal endeavour - and for now I cannot showcase any screenshots or snippets.

                    Between the months of May and August 2019 I completed a course in development with Google Go(Lang). Using this course I was able to build a wide varienty of internal functionality to aid in customer facing productivity, key indicators for sales and success staff, some bot functionalities in our chat product and department wide reports dealing with over 600 thousand rows of data across 3 products.

                <p><br>While attending Waterford Institute of Technology (Systems Software Development) in my first year, I took part in a Charity Hackathon for a local Youth Center, Children’s Group Link. Myself and two other students from my class (Paul Daly & William Croke) placed second out of over 15 teams from all years. Though we didn't win, this experience was the catalyst for my decision that Programming, and software development is where I want to be.
