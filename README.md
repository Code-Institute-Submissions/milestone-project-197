# Personal Portfolio Website

This website is a personal portfolio website to highlight my own skills, experience with programming to target potential employers, collaborators and partners. 

Included in this overview will be insights into my own personal journey as a developer. Sections on Work Experience, Project Experience and semi-formal descriptive text with complimenting images will be the primary content across this small site. 

There will be three pages; 
- home.html
- projects.html
- contact.hmtl

I decided it would be helpful to have a section below my work experience, highlighting any academic and professional achievements that I have attained.
