Below you will find clickable headings, where some insight into the project, and my takeaways will expand.

                    <p>The Teamwork Bot. Often times it feels like this little program is an extension of myself. I began working on small menial functionalities on our internal bot in early 2019 - Since starting work on the bot, I've made over 400 commits. I've build over 15 features for this repo, majority of which designed to promote productivity and visibility across the organization.
                        Some feature highlights include;
                        <ul class="bot-feature-list">
                            <li>Direct Message multi-app notifications</li>
                            <li>Ticket Management - providing key customer account insight through means of triggers and tags</li>
                            <li>A reporting library for Sales and Support</li>
                            <li>New Bug Reports and New Ticket Reports</li>
                        </ul>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible">Teamwork Reports</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Upon starting in Teamwork, I immediately fell in love with the products, and the team I was working with. At this point, some key reporting needs were lacking in one of the softwares we used.<br>After expressing interest in API's, and development - my direct manager offered me a few hours a week to dedicate towards building reports from the APIs avialable to us. In the beginning this seemed like a bit more than I could chew - having to work with over half a million rows of data, and over 40 datapoints per row.
                        <br> I quickly learned that this wouldn't be a quick job, and would require a lot more of my time and effort. After around 4 months of learning Google Scripts, I was able to get the data into Google Sheets for general excel reporting. Again, this quickly got a bit too much to handle due to cell limits within Google Sheets. We found ourselves needing a new sheet every couple of weeks, which isn't optimal. From here, with some help from our developers regarding the APIs, I opted to learn our companies core language, Go(Lang) and have a shot at building a reporting dashboard.
                        The end result here is an internal app, which runs on a recurring CRON job weekly, monthly and quarerly. Using pre-defined parameters, I query and calculate the data - and export it directly into Google Data Studios. Overall this took the guts of a year, but the pride of having built something with complex level of configuration will stay with me a little while longer. Blank Dashboard example; <br>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible">Teamwork Intranet</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>In 2020, a group of colleagues and I endeavoured to build a fully fledged intranet for our company. We worked to figure out our strengths, weaknesses and pulled together to win the Teamwork Annual Hackathon<br>I was the most junior programmer on the team, and it was brilliant to get that kind of high-level programming exposure. A lot of discussion went into allocating roles, and my core responsibilities were acquiring data from 7 different apps (APIS) and combining them into a series of related SQL Tables for each of use.

                    <p>In 2014, I participated in my first of 6 Hackathons. This was while I was attending Water Institute of Technology for Software Systems Development in my first year.<br>
                        Myself and 2 of my classmates, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamcroke?trk=people-guest_people_search-card" target="_blank">William Croke</a> and Paul Daly. Our entry placed #2 out of over 15 teams. This was my first brush with developing as part of a team. Some of my key takeaways from this is constant communication, maluable designs and allocation of work.<br>
